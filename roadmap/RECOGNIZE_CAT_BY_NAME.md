# Cat Recognition by Name - Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the implementation plan for adding individual cat recognition capabilities to the Cat Activities Monitor. The system will transition from "manual naming" to "automatic recognition with human correction" while preserving all current functionality.

## Current State

The existing system:
- Detects "cats" as a general class using YOLO11
- Relies on user feedback for cat naming and identification
- Builds rich cat profiles with metadata but no automatic recognition
- Uses color-coding for visual consistency across sessions

## Proposed Solution: Two-Stage Pipeline

### Architecture
```
Camera Feed → YOLO Detection → Feature Extraction → Cat Classification → Results
                    ↓                    ↓                    ↓
              Bounding Boxes      Feature Vectors      Cat IDs + Confidence
```

### Technical Approach

**Stage 1: Detection (Current System)**
- Keep existing YOLO11 for cat detection
- Maintain current bounding box and confidence scoring
- No changes to existing detection pipeline

**Stage 2: Identification (New)**
- Extract features from detected cat regions using pre-trained models
- Compare features with known cat database
- Classify cats with confidence scoring
- Fall back to "unknown_cat" for low-confidence matches

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 weeks)

#### Database Schema Changes
```sql
-- New table for storing cat feature vectors
CREATE TABLE cat_features (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    cat_name VARCHAR(255) REFERENCES cat_profiles(name),
    feature_vector FLOAT[512],      -- Feature vector from neural network
    image_path VARCHAR(500),        -- Source image for this feature
    extraction_timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    quality_score FLOAT,           -- Image quality metric (0-1)
    pose_variant VARCHAR(50)       -- sitting, standing, lying, etc.
);

-- New table for recognition model management
CREATE TABLE cat_recognition_models (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    model_name VARCHAR(255),
    model_path VARCHAR(500),
    feature_extractor VARCHAR(100), -- resnet50, efficientnet, etc.
    cats_included TEXT[],           -- List of cat names in this model
    created_timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    accuracy_score FLOAT,          -- Model validation accuracy
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

-- Enhance existing detections table
ALTER TABLE detections ADD COLUMN recognized_cat_name VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE detections ADD COLUMN recognition_confidence FLOAT;
ALTER TABLE detections ADD COLUMN is_manually_corrected BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

        self.feature_extractor = self._load_feature_extractor()  # New
        self.cat_classifier = self._load_cat_classifier()  # New
    
    async def process_image_with_recognition(self, image_path: str):
        # Stage 1: Detection (existing)
        detections = self.yolo_model(image_path)
        cat_boxes = self._filter_cats(detections)
        
        # Stage 2: Recognition (new)
        recognized_cats = []
        for box in cat_boxes:
            cat_image = self._crop_image(image_path, box)
            features = self.feature_extractor.extract(cat_image)
            
            # Compare with known cats
            similarities = self._compare_features(features)
            if max(similarities) > self.confidence_threshold:
                cat_id = self._get_best_match(similarities)
                confidence = max(similarities)
            else:
                cat_id = "unknown_cat"
                confidence = 0.0
            
            recognized_cats.append({
                "box": box,
                "cat_name": cat_id,

    async def train_classifier(self, cats_to_include: List[str] = None):
        # Extract features from all confirmed cat images
        training_data = await self._prepare_training_data(cats_to_include)
        
        # Train KNN/SVM classifier on features
        classifier = self._train_classifier(training_data)
        
        # Validate and save model
        accuracy = self._validate_model(classifier, training_data)
        model_path = await self._save_model(classifier, cats_to_include, accuracy)
        
        return {
